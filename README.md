# Youtube-DL Interface

This is an interface I made for youtube-dl because I didn't want to have to remember all the 
arguments or type them in. You enter a URL, select various options like audio extraction, 
press start and it will begin downloading! It is fairly self-explanatory though.

## Requirements
You will need youtube-dl (provided in Executables folder), which can be downloaded from [here](https://youtube-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl.exe).
If you want to extract audio, you will need ffmpeg, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

## Disclaimer
I did NOT make youtube-dl, ffmpeg or any other associated program. I have simply made an interface for these programs.
