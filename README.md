# Youtube-DL Interface

This is an interface I made for youtube-dl because I didn't want to have to remember all the 
arguments or type them in when I wanted some music to put on my phone. 

## Requirements
You will need youtube-dl (provided in Executables folder), which can be downloaded from [here](https://youtube-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl.exe) and ffmpeg, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). There is an update youtube-dl button in the GUI, to save you some hassle.

## How to use
You enter a URL at the top, select audio format and quality, 
press start and it will begin downloading! If youtube-dl is called something else, then there is a box for that too.
If you want the opened command window to remain open after the command is done (mainly used if youtube-dl is not a valid command), 
there is a checkbox for that too.

## Disclaimer
I did NOT make youtube-dl, ffmpeg or any other associated program. I have simply made an interface for these programs.
